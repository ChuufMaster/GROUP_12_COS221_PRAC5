## Coding practices

1. **Videos**

   - Watch and implement all the practices specified in the videos on this guys channel
   - https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic


2. Please make sure to keep the naming of variables as descriptive as possible
3. Avoid more than three levels of indentation/nesting at most
   1. Use extraction to lower the level of nesting or indentation
   2. Use gatekeeping so instead of have a bunch of if-else statements test for all the worst case scenarios before getting to the actual code that you want to execute
4. If a function or piece of code can be put into its own file then do it don't have one big file
5. You naming of functions and variables should be able to be read like a comment
