(316145,231431,'Red Grape','Shiraz',NULL,'Don\'t let the screwcap fool you: this wine has quality written all over it. Twelve months in mostly American oak yields graham cracker and lemon aromas, with young blackberry and herbs supporting. Oak again shows in the mouth, supporting dark fruit flavors. It will be interesting to see how the big tannins age under screwcap, as this wine has years to go. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.',40,67,14.1,'Dark Horse',0),
(316155,231441,'Red Grape','Chenin Blanc',NULL,'Not known for whites, Anura has crafted a very nice Chenin. This golden-hued wine exudes aromas of cooked peanuts, soy dumplings and Asian spices, all wrapped in toasty oak. Nutty and toasty in the mouth, with flavors of olive oil and spice coating moderate white stone fruit. The full, creamy mouthfeel borders on bulky. Imported by DC Imports LLC.',18,93,14.9,'Private Cellar',0),
(316164,231441,'Red Grape','Red Blend',NULL,'A huge wine, clocking in at 15% alcohol, this liqueur-like offering has aromas of plum, mint, cinnamon and hints of  lemon.

(316371,231632,'White Grape','Sauvignon Blanc',NULL,'Tasty Sauvignon, with grass, grapefruit and slate elements in nice balance. It\'s crisp without being sharp, as too many are, and just slightly tangy on the tongue. An attractive wine with a spicy satisfying finish.',12,89,14,'JB',0),
