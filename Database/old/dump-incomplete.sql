Williams Selyem\'s last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.'),

Then there are the flavors, complex and lush in raspberries, cherries, brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. The wine is so delightful to drink now, you might miss out on cellaring it until 2018 to see where it goes.'),

In the mouth, raspberry fruit begins to emerge; the wine is obviously a big, full-bodied and tannic. It\'s meant to age, and we think it will do so just fine. Try in 2008, or pair it with hearty meat dishes if you can\'t hold out that long.'),
('e6b8370aca47814fdd69468bfbfcfc22',329,28,4.5,'This winning blend of 75% Nero d\'Avola and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon is firm and structured, but coddles that structure in a layer of lushness. Briary, raspberry fruit is balanced by darker notes of cassis and chocolate. Drink now-2010.'),
('8a678f890a21a779885fa90b0e457c91',577,29,4.5,'A rich and full-boded white blended from Sauvignon Blanc and Inzolia, the Nozze d\'Oro begins with lightly buttery aromas of passionfruit, before developing melon and peach flavors in the mouth. Finishes long, with a refreshing note of bitter almond.'),

('866cd058c31814a71810f272904dc9bc',1040,35,4.4,'Juicy, sweet and fat in glycerine, this has complex flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling. The tannins and acids give it a fine, elegant structure. Drink now.'),
('2d33aa9838db0fcec2cc814dcca3f832',641,36,4.6,'The two grapes that represent the pride of southern Italian winemaking—Fiano and Greco—are blended here to produce a creamy, rich white wine that will pair well with steamed lobster or crab. Beautifully balanced sensations of acidity and spice appear on the long finish.'),

The wine moves with delicate, feminine steps but is not without power and intensity.'),
('dadd9cc38224678281eca38defec81c7',180,39,4.6,'This is one of the bigger, more powerful Chardonnays out there in the market.

('a41ee71236fe6572b17668c046824ed2',1002,40,4.65,'Something special from the west side of the Salinas Valley, with its fogs and wind. Drinks very bright in acids and even some tannins that frame a melange of flavors, including sweet lime, green apple, and the ripest white peach. Tastes leesy and has the texture of sweet cream. This distinctive wine defines Monterey\'s interpretation of Chardonnay.'),
('21d054743eba9c736015d06d0034bb28',1002,41,4.55,'Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it\'s bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity.'),
('b51c311efde029bb9a53a1f714540b81',249,42,4.35,'Syrah finds a perfect home in Sicily. The sea breezes and sunny weather help give ripe aromas of blackberry, cherry, tobacco and smoked bacon.

('f3b0f6b5f18c35b5fdb34b5a704c2f8f',251,47,4.55,'This is a big wine that\'s not ready now—it\'s too tannic. That gives it a lockdown, numbing quality that blocks a full appreciation of the fruit. But what fruit! Blackberries pure and simple, reduced to their quintessence. Such is the inherent integrity of this wine that it should effortlessly negotiate 4 to 6 years, gradually softening.'),

('98ac9e795a357c80469efa372618896e',233,52,4.6,'This Pinot\'s immediate lusciousness belies its complexity. Your first impression is of ripe raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie. Then layers of minerals, mushrooms, cola and earthier fruits like persimmons and rhubarbs appear, all made brisk by amazing acidity and finishing bone dry. Lovely now and over the next six years, after an hour or two in the decanter.'),

The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don\'t go together, just try the wine. It\'s seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020.'),

It\'s jammy in the intensity of raspberry and cherry fruit, with a savory, Dr. Pepper cola richness. The spiciness, which is one of winemaker Bob Cabral\'s specialties in capturing, is exotic. It\'s a big, fat, rich wine that needs decanting now, and should age for 4–6 years.'),
('8c48bc06e8a05176d817c39da3d0bd29',183,175,4.4,'A pure expression of Grillo, this offers clean fruit, with pristine aromas of citrus, honey and white peach. The finish is crisp and streamlined.'),

(2122,222693,'other','Shiraz',NULL,'Tasty, very international-style Shiraz that will have broad appeal. This delivers ample ripe berry, stewed fruit and leather aromas. On the tongue, it\'s firm and dry, with coffee-chocolate accents on the tangy fruit. Closes with even tannins, and is very drinkable now.',18,NULL,0,'Pumphouse',197445),
(2123,217999,'other','White Blend',NULL,'The name of the wine and the grape is Falanghina. It was well liked by Pliny, Horace and Virgil—and who could argue with them?

The finish is long and echoes the opening notes. Editors\' Choice.',15,NULL,0,'Falanghina Sannio',196908),
(2124,218046,'other','Chardonnay',NULL,'The unexpectedly complex nose of this Chardonnay value shows tangerine and white peach, toast and nut accents.
